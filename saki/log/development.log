PDCAを高速で回している 仕事における重要なサイクルと言われる「PDCAサイクル」。  「Plan-Do-Check-Action」の略で、日本語で言うと「計画-実行-評価-改善」という仕事の理想的な流れのことを指します。  優秀な人は頭の中で、このPDCAサイクルをより早く、より正確に回しています。仕事を実行するだけでなく、計画や仕事の評価をきちんと行うことで、次の仕事での成果につなげているのです。   行動2. 自分のできることできないことを把握し、目標達成のためにチームで補填し合おうとする 仕事の優秀な人は自分の出来る事と出来ないことを把握している  いくら優秀な人でも、全ての仕事を一人でこなせるわけではありません。  本当に優秀な人は自分ができることとできないことをしっかり把握し、自分で出来ない分は、他の人の力を上手く頼って最高のパフォーマンスを実現しようとします。  仕事はチームプレイ。自分の力量と他の人の能力をきちんと理解してこそ成果を出すことができるのです。   行動3. マルチタスクは行わず、一つの仕事に集中する 複数の仕事を同時に進めようとすると、どうしても一つの仕事に割ける集中力が落ちてしまうもの。  優秀な人はなるべくマルチタスクを避け、一つの仕事に集中することで自分の力を最大限発揮します。  もちろん仕事上、複数の仕事が重なることはありますし、優秀な人であれば仕事が集まることもあるでしょう。しかし、優秀な人は「一つの仕事をやる時は他のことをいったん忘れる」ことで、集中力を上げているのです。   行動4. 感覚ではなく、数値で判断する 物事を感覚的に判断してしまうと正確な仕事の方針が立てづらくなってしまいますし、人に説明する時の説得力も落ちてしまいます。  そのため優秀な人はなるべく感覚ではなく数値やデータを優先し、客観的に物事を判断しようとします。  「他の人が見ても同じ結論になるか？」を意識すれば、幅広い仕事で成果を出せるようになるでしょう。   行動5. 仕事に対してスキルアップを欠かさないで行っている 仕事の出来る優秀な人はスキルアップを欠かさない  優秀な人は、日頃から努力を欠かしません。優秀な人は将来の目標に向け仕事の場だけでなくプライベートの時間も仕事を意識していますので、資格などの勉強ををするケースも多数。仕事が忙しい中でも、スキマ時間をスキルアップに充てています。  毎日勉強したり体調にもきちんと気を配ることで、今以上の成長が実現できるでしょう。   行動6. 必要最低限の人数で最高のパフォーマンスを発揮しようと考えている 優秀な人はいつも仕事の効率について考えているもの。より少ないコストで仕事の成果を上げるため、その場にいる人たちの能力を最大限生かせる環境を作ります。  より少ない人数で仕事が進めば、余った人はさらに別の仕事を進められるようになります。  自分のことだけでなく、周りの仲間全体に気を配ることで、最高のパフォーマンスが実現できるのです。   行動7. ビジネスや人生におけるメンターを作っている メンターとは、仕事や人生における指導者のこと。優秀な人はこのメンターを持ち、その人の助言を常に意識しつつ仕事を進めています。  自分の指針となるメンターに出会えるかどうかは運次第なところもありますが、優秀な人は自分にとっての良い指導者を見つけるべく、会社以外でも様々な人との出会いを大切にします。  そしてメンターとなった人の意見やアドバイスを仕事や生活の中で最大限生かしているのです。   行動8. ニュースや政治など最新の情報を常にチェックしている 仕事の優秀な人は最新の情報をチェックする  世界各地の情報を知ることで、仕事で役立つアイディアを思いつきやすくなります。優秀な人はニュースや政治など最新の情報に対して高い感度を持ち、「何か仕事で生かせることはないか」と常に意識しています。  一見仕事に関係なさそうなことが少しのきっかけでビジネスチャンスになるケースも。  一流の人は常に情報を集め、仕事との繋がりを見つけようとしているのです。   行動9. 自分の作業だけではなく、組織全体の進捗を重視している 優秀な人は常に視野を広く持っています。仕事では自分の作業の進み具合だけでなく他の人の進捗までチェックし、何かあればチーム全体の問題として対処しようとします。  自分の仕事に加え周りのことまで気を配るのは、非常に難しいこと。しかし一流の仕事人であれば、「仕事の成功」を実現するためチームとしてのベストをいつも意識しています。   優秀ではない人の特徴から紐解く、優秀な人との大きな5つの違い 優秀な人と優秀でない人の違い  優秀な人の特徴については分かりましたが、気になるのは「いったいどうしたら優秀になれるのか」。  仕事でも生活でも、出来ることなら今以上に優秀になってどんどん成果を上げたいですよね。  ここからは優秀でない人と優秀な人との特徴を比較。どこに差があるのか知ることで「優秀な人」に一歩近づけるでしょう。   特徴1. やる前から「できない」を口癖にしている 優秀ではない人は新しいことにチャレンジせず、なるべく現状維持をしようとします。  しかし、やる前から諦めているとチャレンジするチャンス自体が減ってしまい、優秀な人のようにどんどん仕事が集まる環境が無くなってしまいます。  一見「難しいかな」と感じられる仕事にも、新たな気づきがあるもの。「できない」と言わず、どんどん挑戦することが大切です。   特徴2. チームのミスは自分の責任ではないと考えている 仕事はチームで取り組むものです。そのためチームのミスはメンバーそれぞれが自分のミスとしてとらえ、解決しなければならない問題だと言えるでしょう。  しかし、優秀でない人はチームのミスと自分は関係ないと考え、課題解決の努力を怠りがち。  忙しい中でも自分のことだけでなく同じ職場の仲間として成功できるよう、常にチーム全体の進捗を意識することが大切です。   特徴3. 仕事が難しいことを言い訳にし、スキルアップしようと努力していない 優秀でない人はスキルアップしない  仕事が難しく、なかなか時間が取れないからといって、仕事以外の時間を全て遊びに使ってしまう人は少なくありません。しかし、優秀な人であれば空いた時間にスキルアップに向けた努力を行います。  ただ仕事の難しさに翻弄されるだけでなく、常に「どう頑張れば自分は成長できるか」を意識することで、優秀な人に近づきます。   特徴4. 全て自分で作業を完遂させようとしているか チームでの協力も職場では大切ですが、自分が担当する仕事はきちんとこなすことが大前提。  自分の都合で仕事を終わらせることが出来ないからと、すぐに人に頼んでしまうのはNGです。仕事を他の人に任せることで成長の機会を失ってしまいますし、「仕事をすぐに押し付ける人」として同僚からの評判も悪くなってしまいます。  自分の仕事は自分で片づけることを意識し、成長のチャンスを最大限に生かしましょう。   特徴5. 「たぶんできるだろう」と曖昧な計画を立てている 優秀でない人は、「PDCAサイクル」のPlan、つまり計画の部分が曖昧なまま仕事に手を付けてしまうケースが多いです。  「たぶんできる」という曖昧な見通しで仕事を進めると、期限直前に焦ってしまい、最大限の力を発揮できなくなってしまいます。  優秀な人になるためには、計画が大切。仕事の進め方やトラブルが起きた時の対処まで、あらかじめ考えておきましょう。   優秀な人になりたい！優秀な人になるために今から始められる5つの習慣 優秀な人になるための習慣  優秀な人は、仕事に役立つ習慣をいつも実行しているもの。良い習慣を身に付けることで、仕事への意識が高まり、今いる場所を自己成長のための場所に変化させることが出来ます。  ここからは優秀な人になるための5つの習慣を紹介していきますので、「仕事で成果を出したい」という方はぜひチェックしてくださいね。   習慣1. 毎日一日のスケジュールを朝一番に決める 一日のスケジュールを決めておけば、仕事をスムーズに進められます。  朝少しいつもより早く起き、一日のスケジュールや今日の予定を確認するという習慣は、仕事の計画を立てる練習にもなるでしょう。  決めたスケジュールはスマートフォンのメモなどに残しておくと効果的です。その日一日は決めたスケジュールに従い、一流のパフォーマンスを発揮できるよう意識しておきましょう。   習慣2. 手を動かすことではなく、頭を動かしてどう仕事が効率化するかを考える 集中力を高めるために手を動かすことも時には必要ですが、より効率的に仕事をするためには計画が大切。  仕事に手をつける前にまずは頭の中で仕事の進め方を確認し、さらに効率化できる方法がないか考えることで、仕事のスピードが上がります。  最初はなかなか難しいですが、「無駄を省く」という意識で仕事のやり方を見直してみると良いでしょう。   習慣3. 同じミスをしないよう、仕事が完了しても振り返る 仕事が出来る人になるための習慣は仕事を振り返る  仕事にはミスがつきもの。優秀な人は同じミスを再度繰り返さないよう、仕事後に自分の反省点について考えます。  繰り返し同じミスをしてしまうと、「仕事が出来ない人」というイメージがついてしまい職場での肩身も狭くなってしまいます。  まずは、自分が起こしたミスの内容を分析し、今後の改善方法について日頃から考えていきましょう。   習慣4. 仕事に関する資格など、隙間時間を利用してスキルアップを図る 優秀な人として成長を続けるためには、日頃からスキルアップを意識することが大切。  仕事に関する資格勉強をすれば理解も早いですし、努力が成果や給与に反映されやすくなり、勉強のモチベーションを維持しやすくなります。  忙しい中ですが隙間時間を利用しながら少しずつ勉強をすることで、仕事全体に対する意識も高まります。   習慣5. 優秀な人と仲良くなり、行動や考え方、仕事術などを学ぶ 優秀な人の真似をすれば、自分もいつの間にか優秀な人になっています。  まずはあなたの身近にいる優秀な人と仲良くなり、その人が普段どんなことをしているのか、仕事に対してどう考えているかなど、学べるところはできる限り真似してみましょう。  もちろん自分に合った方法で仕事をすることも大切ですが、優秀な人と直接話すことで新たな発見があるかもしれません。   優秀になるための習慣を実行して、仕事で評価されるようになろう！ 優秀名人になる習慣をつけて優秀になろう  優秀な人は、どれだけ自分が良い環境にあっても努力を怠りません。  また、優秀な人は自分のことだけでなく周りの人の能力やチーム全体の成果にまで気を配ります。  優秀な人になるためには、日頃から努力を続け、より広い視野を持つことが大切。まずはあなたの周りの優秀な人を観察し、行動などを学ぶところから始めてみましょう。   【参考記事】はこちら▽  仕事ができる人の性格や条件とは？考え方や習慣を学んで仕事の仕方を変えよう！ | Smartlog仕事ができる人の性格や条件とは？考え方や習慣を学んで仕事の仕方を変えよう！

PDCAを高速で回している 仕事における重要なサイクルと言われる「PDCAサイクル」。  「Plan-Do-Check-Action」の略で、日本語で言うと「計画-実行-評価-改善」という仕事の理想的な流れのことを指します。  優秀な人は頭の中で、このPDCAサイクルをより早く、より正確に回しています。仕事を実行するだけでなく、計画や仕事の評価をきちんと行うことで、次の仕事での成果につなげているのです。   行動2. 自分のできることできないことを把握し、目標達成のためにチームで補填し合おうとする 仕事の優秀な人は自分の出来る事と出来ないことを把握している  いくら優秀な人でも、全ての仕事を一人でこなせるわけではありません。  本当に優秀な人は自分ができることとできないことをしっかり把握し、自分で出来ない分は、他の人の力を上手く頼って最高のパフォーマンスを実現しようとします。  仕事はチームプレイ。自分の力量と他の人の能力をきちんと理解してこそ成果を出すことができるのです。   行動3. マルチタスクは行わず、一つの仕事に集中する 複数の仕事を同時に進めようとすると、どうしても一つの仕事に割ける集中力が落ちてしまうもの。  優秀な人はなるべくマルチタスクを避け、一つの仕事に集中することで自分の力を最大限発揮します。  もちろん仕事上、複数の仕事が重なることはありますし、優秀な人であれば仕事が集まることもあるでしょう。しかし、優秀な人は「一つの仕事をやる時は他のことをいったん忘れる」ことで、集中力を上げているのです。   行動4. 感覚ではなく、数値で判断する 物事を感覚的に判断してしまうと正確な仕事の方針が立てづらくなってしまいますし、人に説明する時の説得力も落ちてしまいます。  そのため優秀な人はなるべく感覚ではなく数値やデータを優先し、客観的に物事を判断しようとします。  「他の人が見ても同じ結論になるか？」を意識すれば、幅広い仕事で成果を出せるようになるでしょう。   行動5. 仕事に対してスキルアップを欠かさないで行っている 仕事の出来る優秀な人はスキルアップを欠かさない  優秀な人は、日頃から努力を欠かしません。優秀な人は将来の目標に向け仕事の場だけでなくプライベートの時間も仕事を意識していますので、資格などの勉強ををするケースも多数。仕事が忙しい中でも、スキマ時間をスキルアップに充てています。  毎日勉強したり体調にもきちんと気を配ることで、今以上の成長が実現できるでしょう。   行動6. 必要最低限の人数で最高のパフォーマンスを発揮しようと考えている 優秀な人はいつも仕事の効率について考えているもの。より少ないコストで仕事の成果を上げるため、その場にいる人たちの能力を最大限生かせる環境を作ります。  より少ない人数で仕事が進めば、余った人はさらに別の仕事を進められるようになります。  自分のことだけでなく、周りの仲間全体に気を配ることで、最高のパフォーマンスが実現できるのです。   行動7. ビジネスや人生におけるメンターを作っている メンターとは、仕事や人生における指導者のこと。優秀な人はこのメンターを持ち、その人の助言を常に意識しつつ仕事を進めています。  自分の指針となるメンターに出会えるかどうかは運次第なところもありますが、優秀な人は自分にとっての良い指導者を見つけるべく、会社以外でも様々な人との出会いを大切にします。  そしてメンターとなった人の意見やアドバイスを仕事や生活の中で最大限生かしているのです。   行動8. ニュースや政治など最新の情報を常にチェックしている 仕事の優秀な人は最新の情報をチェックする  世界各地の情報を知ることで、仕事で役立つアイディアを思いつきやすくなります。優秀な人はニュースや政治など最新の情報に対して高い感度を持ち、「何か仕事で生かせることはないか」と常に意識しています。  一見仕事に関係なさそうなことが少しのきっかけでビジネスチャンスになるケースも。  一流の人は常に情報を集め、仕事との繋がりを見つけようとしているのです。   行動9.
